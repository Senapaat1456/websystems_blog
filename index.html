    <h1>Independent Research</h1>
    <h3>Blog Entry: 2/17/2020</h3>
    <p>One of the things I was interested in was learning how to display certain kinds of media on the web. For my project, I am thinking about building a website for an campus organization I am part of, ‘Data Analytic Association’ . My goal would be to design a site that has useful resources for new members. This would include guides for how to set-up software we use and some walk-throughs on how to use some of the statistical tools our organization uses. This would require me to embed lots of information into the web pages.  For example, embedding videos or tables into a web page in using HTML.</p>
    <h4>Embedding Videos</h4>
    <p>The simplest approach to embedding videos in to simply embed a YouTube video into the web page. Some example code can be see bellow:</p>
    <p class="code_box">&#60;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dQw4w9WgXcQ?controls=0" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen"&#62;
      	&#60;/iframe&#62
    </p>
    <p>And the code in action:</p>
    <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dQw4w9WgXcQ" frameborder="0"  allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
